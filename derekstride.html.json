As we loom upon Web3, so does the new dawn in the reaches that\ntechnology has and the opportunities inspired by this latest facelift. The\nSandbox, a virtual Metaverse that lives within the new web 3.0, brings with it\na heap of new opportunities we will explore in-depth in this Sandbox game\nreview and guide.</p>\n\n<p>The Sandbox is a wild-wild west kind of gameplay-focused\nfrontier, with major partners ranging from Snoop Dogg, Atari &amp; Adidas to\nSamsung and Coincheck, The Sandbox is a community-metaverse started on and\npowered by the blockchain. Here, the virtual LANDs, ASSETs, and businesses to\nNFT museums and 24/7 discos, the Sandbox game creates a rich opportunity cost\nto live out all the creative dreams you have ever had.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2><a></a><b>What is the\nSandbox?</b></h2>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  The\nSandbox is the best evolution of social media, moving from the adoration-driven\nmodels to one that people can truly create another life on in this gaming\necosystem. The Sandbox game is a community-driven, decentralized platform\nexisting on the Ethereum blockchain and a space where users can own land,\nassets, or complete experiences as a character. One can make create and play\ngames with features like Game Maker or get paid to create and share the\ncreations you’ve made with the Game Maker Fund.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  The\nSandbox also allows you to buy NFT land and monetize on it, whether it’s\nthrough hosting contests to voting in the Metaverse governance, or even staking\nSAND, the native coin to the Sandbox game. With only 166,464 available plots of\nland, the price is rising quickly as Sandbox takes on a life of its own, built\nfor creators, by creators through 100% user-generated content.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2><a></a><b>How to Play the Sandbox</b></h2>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Sandbox is relatively simple to access; First, you’ll need to\ncreate a Sandbox account from <a href=\"http://sandbox.game\">sandbox</a><a href=\"http://sandbox.game\">.</a><a href=\"http://sandbox.game\">game</a> on the blockchain. User\nprofiles are created through your browser wallet, such as Metamask, then enter\nyour email and create a password, before downloading the zip file, unpacking,\nand installing the game’s platform onto your computer, which should take up 300\nMB. Within your profile on the site, you can customize your avatar, browse LAND\navailable for sale and explore the many creator tools available.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>       </p><p>       5000\nalpha passes were distributed through a rewards system prior to and during the\nAlpha launch, giving the owner access to all 18 initially available\nexperiences. If you did not get an Alpha pass, you were still able to access 3\nof these platforms. The Alpha phase went from November 29th, 2021\nuntil December 20th, 2021; we are now in the between time until\nseason 2 comes out.             &nbsp;</p><p><b><br></b></p><h2><b>How does the Sandbox work?</b></h2>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Currently, the Sandbox beta has\nconcluded, so it's unavailable to access but with Alpha season 2 making its way\nto market, let’s get you prepared. The idea of The Sandbox is a community-driven\nspace to help fuel the creators while simultaneously rewarding the players and\ncontributors, in fact over 5 million SAND was rewarded during season 1 alone!\nExclusive NFT collections including Snoop Dogg, The Walking Dead, Smurfs, and\nDeadmau5 all call the Sandbox home, a legit list of both status and money.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  The\nSandbox game is also a place for creators to thrive, allowing game makers to\ncreate free 3D games. The VoxEdit features also allow for a lot of control with\nthe world, which can generate anything from people (NPCs) to animals, tools,\nand randomized objects. The Sandbox is essentially a place for everyone in the\nMetaverse to easily collaborate, sell, create and purchase NFTs, ASSETs, and\nLANDs.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<h2><b><br></b></h2><h2><b><br></b></h2><h2><b><br></b></h2><h2><b><br></b></h2><h2><b><br></b></h2><h2><b><br></b></h2><h2><b>How to make money on the Sandbox</b><br></h2>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  In\nthe Sandbox ecosystem, creating income can be done in a variety of ways, paying\nthe native token, SAND. You can design and profit from your own 3D games made\npossible with the Sandbox Game Maker or play premade ones ending with rewards.\nAny owned LAND can be rented to other players; use ASSETS to colonize it and\nincrease its value, it may even make the Community news!</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>You can also create ASSETS with the VoxEdit feature and then\nupload them to the marketplace as NFTs. These can be many things from cars to\nanimals to bikes and the income from them can range from a few SAND tokens to a\nfew thousand SAND tokens. Ever forward-thinking, the ecosystem pays for all the\nEthereum gas fees on behalf of the users, while 50% of the transaction volume\nis routed to The Sandbox Foundation, a promotor, and grantor for the metaverse.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<h2>&nbsp;<b>How much can you earn on the\nSandbox?</b></h2>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  The\npotential of earnings in the Sandbox is at a virtually limitless ceiling, all\npun intended. If you happened to grab one of the 5000 Alpha passes being sold\noff prior the November 27th, you would’ve had full access to the 18\nexperiences and thus, would have put you in the top-earning category, with an\nAlpha pass, playing earns you both SAND and NFTs split between 5 levels of\nrewards.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  Using\nthe Sandbox launcher downloaded from the main site, you can find a guru who\nwill give you quests to complete. You are primarily driven by recognizing and\nfinding places and items throughout those experiences and quests. The more you\ncomplete, the more your level grows and the larger reward you get. Each\nexperience hosts its own guru, objectives, and earning potential; and by the\nend of level 5, I earned 1000 SAND &amp; 3 NFTs, worth maybe 0.025 ETH.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2>&nbsp;</h2><h2><b><br></b></h2><h2><b><br></b></h2><h2><b>Conclusion</b> </h2>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  As\nWeb3 begins to take hold of the internet’s future, creative-driven,\ndecentralized communities will undoubtedly start sprouting across the Metaverse\nplanes. Groundbreaking marketplaces like The Sandbox have already carved their\nway into the foreseeable future, allowing players and creators to continue\npromoting a symbiotic myriad of experiences, in the way that crypto as a whole\nhas spurred a brand-new class of economists and entrepreneurs alike.</p>\n\n<p>One day, we may have the Sandbox on our iOS iPhones, Android,\nand other mobile devices, enabling us to play and earn no matter where we are\nin the world, virtual Meta’s like The Sandbox can keep us forever connected.\nThe idea is simple yet elegant, reward players to play, reward creators to\ncreate, and encourage LAND owners to make the most out of their investment;

He asserted not only can we not have perfect love without perfect loss,\nand vice versa; perfect love itself unattainable, an ideal common for the romantic\nwriters. He exaggerates this ideal to be the perfect person you must have\nperfect love and loss both and also seemed to see familial structure of his day\nas well as society’s normality with religion as other vital catalysts for man’s\nmental instability. However, it seems that to Poe, full self-realization can\nnever occur without madness and downfall. This seems to beg two questions: One,\nwas this theme of downfall merely a technique utilized by Poe to liven up his\nwork, in hopes of keeping his readers enticed by searching for the cause of\nthis downfall with each new story? And two, was this theme of downfall a\npopular topic for writers of Poe’s day or was it a facet that made Poe the\nunique writer he is celebrated as today? Was it, in the end, this struggle for\nself-actualization that truly was the catalyst for the madness of man,\naccording to Poe and his contemporaries? </p>\n\n<p>  First, we must\ndictate what it is Poe considers perfect love, and that is namely, perfect\nloss. Man cannot understand what it is to fully love somebody until they lose\nthat love they thought viewed as perfect. This is evidenced through many of\nPoe’s most famous works, a view of which will be broken down here.</p>\n\n<p>  Ligeia is a story\nof a man driven into madness and melancholy following the loss of his childhood\nlove, &nbsp;he enters into a loveless marriage\nwith a woman named Rowena. Eventually Rowena, like Ligeia, fall ill and\neventually succumb to human mortality and perish. Many of Poe’s common themes\nare riddled throughout this work: the loss of a beautiful young woman, a man\ndriven into mental instability, the dead coming back to life in the form of\nwhat the narrator wants most. These themes seem to be common in many of his\nmost famous works and thus it begs the question, what is it in life that causes\nthe downfall of men into mental frailty and eventually doom? The answer is the\nperfect woman that man can never have. In Ligeia, the description of the lady\nlove herself is almost beyond human, she was the “beauty which passed into my\nspirit, there dwelling as in a shrine, I derived, from many existences in the\nmaterial world, a sentiment such as I felt always aroused within me by her\nlarge and luminous orbs” (Poe 99). She is so perfectly beautiful he becomes\nentranced by her beauty, he is “possessed with a passion to discover” (Poe 99)\nthe radiance she hides from the rest of the world.&nbsp;</p><p>  She is so perfect for his wondrous\nnature he does not even ponder what the feeling of losing her would be until he\nactually does. This sends him into a deep plight of grief which is also a\ncomment on how perfect Ligeia is, she is perfectly beautiful and causes the\nmost perfect grief; “That she loved me I should not have doubted; and I might\nhave been easily aware that, in a bosom such as hers, love would have reigned\nno ordinary passion but in death only, was I fully impressed with the strength\nof her affection” (Poe 101). The poem shifts from angelic descriptions of her\nenchanting beauty to ones of hopelessness following her death because his own\ninternal self-worth only\ncomes from Ligeia’s love. His marriage to Rowena is therefore lackluster\nbecause his happiness only rests in his memories. However, he would never be a\nfully realized adult in Poe’s vision because he needs to lose her to know the\nfull weight of heartbreak. </p>\n\n<p>  So, the loss of what the narrator of Ligeia\nhas perceived as his true love drives him into madness, in fact, it decimates\nhis chances of ever having a real relationship with another person. That being\nstated, his marriage to Rowena was doomed from the start because the loss of\nLigeia has left him fully realized as to what love is and to him, that is\nLigeia, not Rowena or anyone else in the world. His fixation over his love for\nhis childhood love even seems to distract his full emotions when Rowena falls\nill, which points even more to this ideal of one true love. In this work, Poe\nuses women for a catalyst to destroy men by being to perfect for them and only\nremaining with them forever if they forgo any chance at future happiness with a\nnew suitor; that if you remain spiritually in debt to your ‘true love’ than\nmaybe one day, you will get to be with them again. [Good idea about being\nspiritually in debt to the dead, perfect woman!]</p>\n\n<p><i>  Annabel\nLee</i>, arguably one of Poe’s\nmost famous works to date, is one of the best examples of this same perfect\nlove is only perfect when coupled with perfect loss. It is love so perfect that\nit must lead to absolute mental destruction because love is meant to be perfect\nyet unattainable. According to The New World Encyclopedia, “Dark Romantics\n[Poe, Melville, Hawthorne, most notably] are much less confident about the\nnotion perfection is an innate quality of mankind . . . individuals are prone\nto sin and self-destruction, not inherently possessing divinity and wisdom”\n(New World Encyclopedia Contributors). <i>Annabel\nLee</i> was Poe’s most best depiction of man who loses his mental stability\nfollowing the loss of true love, because unlike <i>Ligeia</i> where the love is resurrected, <i>Annabel Lee</i>’s narrator never gets his true, childhood love back but\ninstead spends the rest of his life “bringing the dreams / of the beautiful\nAnnabel Lee” (Poe 36-7). He will never be able to be as happy as he once was\nwhile he was in love, but is instead content sleeping next to her tomb for the\nrest of his days. This story is the ultimate dedication to perfect love and\nloss and in fact on of the only ones in which the narrator experiences both\nperfect loss and perfect love without ever getting his lost-love back. [Can he\nget Annabel Lee back from death? Does he really get Ligeia back? Or is it just\nsome nightmarish version of her, or just his own opium-terror? I think it’s\ninteresting to argue that Ligeia and narrator are reunited at end in some sort\nof celebration of their love, but you may need to make that case more clear in\nyour analysis.]</p>\n\n<p><i>  Berenice</i> is a different taste of Poe, but one that is\ntoo riddled with all the fixings of Poe’s commentary on the causes of men to\nfall from stability. Instead of it being the loss of a woman, which directly\ncauses Egaeus, in this case, to lose his mind we find a narrator whose mind\nalready seems to be quite gone. He is obsessed with books and objects of\nimagination that seem to alleviate his mind from his apparent boredom of living\nin the “noon of manhood. . . still in the mansion of [his] father’s” (Poe 171).\nEgaeus is a gloomy man set to marry his cousin Berenice but unlike the narrator\nof Ligeia, Egaeus does not seek love he seeks escape and he does that through his\nimagination. He sees himself as inherently different from Berenice, saying “I,\nill of health, and buried gloom – she agile, graceful, and overflowing with\nenergy; hers the ramble on the hill side, mine the studies of the cloister, I\nliving within my own heart and addicted body and soul to the most intense and\npainful meditation – she roaming carelessly through life with no thought of the\nshadows in her path” (Poe 172). Berenice is the narrators polar opposite; while\nLigeia was to perfect for her narrator, Berenice is to free for hers. The women\nrepresent what the narrators long for but ultimately cannot have. Following\nBerenice’s death, the Egaeus loses this fixation of freedom which eventually\nleads him to mental downfall as he finds an object that both reminds him of her\nfreedom but also alleviates his obsessive needs to have something that allows\nhim to escape his life. Here, the woman also becomes the catalyst for man’s\ndownfall, only because she represents an idea of self-freedom the narrator\ncould never have himself instead of a romantic love; however, the idea that one\nneeds someone else in order to achieve this idea of fully realized self-freedom\nalso coincides with Poe’s theme of perfect loss and love in order to reach\nself-actualization. </p>\n\n<p><br></p><p>  There is no doubt that Poe was one of the\nmost celebrated writers of the Romantic period and of American literature in\ngeneral. One of these things that makes him the ideal Romantic author was his\nability to rebel against the popular literature he was raised in, namely the\nworks and ideologies of the age of Enlightment. John Fawell discusses in his\nessay <i>Romanticism, Spirituality, and the\nContemporary University, </i>“when I teach Romanticism I often turn to one\npassage from Edgar Allan Poe's short story ‘The Black Cat’ to get at what I\nthink is a central idea of Romanticism, the passage in which Poe's narrator\ntries to understand, to explain to himself, why he has offered violence to his\nfavorite pet cat, first gouging out its eye and finally hanging it [and] concludes\nthat what lead him to hang the cat, what lead him to his ‘final and irrevocable\noverthrow,’ was the ‘spirit of perverseness” (Fawell 223). [quote too long,\nparaphrase idea] Poe describes this perverseness in <i>The Black Cat </i>as “the unfathomable longing of the soul to vex\nitself” (Poe 65) as an almost innate need that dwells within each of us. In\nother words, we are all built to eventually come to a downfall, so then if we\naccept the definition of perverseness in this instance to mean, “willfully\ndetermined or disposed to go counter of what is expected or desired” and we\nknow Romantic’s were typically rebellious against the Enlightment, perverseness\nis a necessary element for Poe.</p>\n\n<p>  Furthermore, if we accept this as a moral\nground that Poe upheld, the notion that in order to be self-actualized we must\nknow absolute acceptance and absolute rebellion, it would stand to reason why\nall of his work resulted in the downfall. One cannot possibly achieve perfect\nacceptance without rebellion against the established order and loss is common\nwhen one is attempting to create something new or at least contribute to the\nrising Romanticists, in his own case. This is poised to lead man into madness\nand Poe was no stranger to such, as evidenced by his long plethora of macabre\nworks dedicated to the causes of the man’s madness.  It was rebellious to write unhappy stories and\nthis seemed to fuel Poe, someone who consistently felt dejected by society, as\nwell as “greatly depressed by reversal of fortune, separation from loved ones,\ninsecurity, and what to him was the frightful enigma of death” (Ostrom 44). </p>\n\n<p>  Poe used downfall to keep readers interested,\nutilizing it as a hook device to keep readers coming back to his strange tales.\nIn her essay <i>The hidden god and the\nabjected woman in 'The Fall of the House of Usher,' </i>Diane Long Hoeveler\nbelieves such a thing is just the case, that this keeps the reading searching\nfor an overall meaning when the meaning of <i>The\nFall of the House of Usher </i>is in fact abstract and up to interpretation.\nShe asserts, “we follow any lead Poe drops in front of us, following it to\nblind passages and discover alas, only our mirror image staring back at us in\nmockery” (Hoeveler 385). The book that the narrator reads to Roderick before\nMadeline rises from the dead, Vigiliae Mortuorum, also raises this question of\nreligion and its importance to Poe’s work, but specifically here to <i>House of Usher</i>. The rare Latin book\nhighlights Roderick’s eccentric taste, but what this books presence in the\nstory suggests according to Hoeveler is that the “Vigiliae Mortuorum tropes a\nreligious history and ideology that have long been buried beneath the more\nextravagant gothic surface of both its own text and ‘The Fall of the House’,\nboth which seemed to be written gothic and surely the reference to the book\nconveys specifically discursive nature of history in the text” (Hoeveler\n386-7). &nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>  Essentially, society, which seems to rest\nupon religion in a major way, is by nature, discursive. Religion has always\nbeen surrounded by the mental downfall of not only individuals but also societies,\nyet religion presents itself as immortal. Poe seemed to recognize this, and\nthis theme of religion as a catalyst for downfall seemed to even spill into\nother works (i.e<i>. The Pit and the\nPendulum</i>).  This is not to say he did\nnot believe in God nor is that the assertion here, he just seemed to not see\nGod as a pure entity free of responsibility for the pain of human life. His use\nof the twins of Roderick and Madeline in <i>Fall\nof the House of Usher</i> could even be alluding to Christ and the Virgin Mary,\ndepicting the downfall of Christ as a result of religion’s failure to curb the\nsins of humanity thus religion itself is seen as a failure, if we fully\nrecognize Hoeveler’s consensus as containing some sort of truth into Poe’s\nmind. If we do, then Roderick and Madeline are the over-exaggeration products\nof human ego, both wild hypochondriacs, doomed to downfall because of their\nfamily’s devotion to society, which is depicted by their wealthy status and\nthus social acceptance because of it, something Poe’s poverty never let him\nknow personally. “Poe suggests that [like the human emotions of love and loss],\nhistory and religion can only be understood primarily as discourse systems,\ndialogical constructs that sacrifice male strength and creativity to the\nfemale- embodied powers of life and death, in other words, the cyclical nature\nof generation, that [Roderick and Madeline] no longer believe in themselves\nbecause they understand the fictional nature of both history and religion &amp;\nconsequently, like their creator, they only have the energy to self destruct”\n(Hoeveler 387-8). Downfall is the natural cycle of life people wants to ignore\nand Poe sought to naturalize within his texts. He truly makes the statement of\nthe woman as the ultimate catalyst for downfall however, and <i>Fall of the House</i> does not escape the\nPoe technique because it is quite clear that “Roderick is the archetypal\ndispossessed male, the victim of his own narcissistic fantasies of the perfect\nfeminine complement . . . Poe is the author of Roderick’s vision of cultural\ndecay and historical meaninglessness” (Hoeveler 392-3). </p>\n\n<p>  Loss in this\ncentury was a powerful commonality that could and often did guide, according to\nPoe, the course of human life; this mourning of lost-love then by large,\nbecomes more dear than life itself. As Adam Bradford discusses in his essay <i>Inspiring\nDeath: Poe’s Poetic Aesthetics, “Annabel Lee,” and the Communities of Mourning\nin Nineteenth-Century America </i>that the ritual of mourning in the American 19th  century was very different than it is\nnow, where as we do not commemorate death in the infinite manner that a writer\nin the Romantic period such as Poe would have; “In mourning portraiture and\nconsolation verse, the deceased were frequently depicted enjoying a glorious\nafterlife which included reunion and continued association with previously\ndeparted family and loved ones. These affectively charged images, as I will\nshow, also held out the possibility of a similar reunion for the deceased and\nthe mourner in some future moment” (Bradford 76). &nbsp;So, then\nPoe could not possibly have been the only Romantic writer that utilized this\ntheme of downfall into his work because in fact themes of downfall into madness\nwere prominent, although Poe was a leading figure in the macabre, downfall and\nperfect love/loss were most definitely not unique to Poe but greatly used\namongst his contemporaries.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p></p>"},{"id":"silex-id-1648650697700-35","tagName":"DIV","type":"text-element","alt":null,"title":null,"isSectionContent":false,"visibility":{"desktop":true,"mobile":true},"style":{"mobile":{},"desktop":{"width":"513px","height":"106px","position":"absolute","top":"45px","left":"695px"}},"data":{"component":null},"children":[],"pageNames":["page-the-creation-of-the-gothic"],"classList":[],"attr":{},"link":null,"enableEdit":true,"enableDrag":true,"enableDrop":false,"enableResize":{"top":true,"bottom":true,"left":true,"right":true},"selected":false,"useMinHeight":true,"innerHtml":"<h2>The
