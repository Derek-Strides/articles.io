obsessed with discovering the causes for the downfall in the mental stability of
man. He asserted not only can we not have perfect love without perfect loss,
and vice versa; perfect love itself unattainable, an ideal common for the romantic
writers. He exaggerates this ideal to be the perfect person you must have
perfect love and loss both and also seemed to see familial structure of his day
as well as society’s normality with religion as other vital catalysts for man’s
mental instability. However, it seems that to Poe, full self-realization can
never occur without madness and downfall. This seems to beg two questions: One,
was this theme of downfall merely a technique utilized by Poe to liven up his
work, in hopes of keeping his readers enticed by searching for the cause of
this downfall with each new story? And two, was this theme of downfall a
popular topic for writers of Poe’s day or was it a facet that made Poe the
unique writer he is celebrated as today? Was it, in the end, this struggle for
self-actualization that truly was the catalyst for the madness of man,
according to Poe and his contemporaries? </p>

<p>  First, we must
dictate what it is Poe considers perfect love, and that is namely, perfect
loss. Man cannot understand what it is to fully love somebody until they lose
that love they thought viewed as perfect. This is evidenced through many of
Poe’s most famous works, a view of which will be broken down here.</p>

<p>  Ligeia is a story
of a man driven into madness and melancholy following the loss of his childhood
love, &nbsp;he enters into a loveless marriage
with a woman named Rowena. Eventually Rowena, like Ligeia, fall ill and
eventually succumb to human mortality and perish. Many of Poe’s common themes
are riddled throughout this work: the loss of a beautiful young woman, a man
driven into mental instability, the dead coming back to life in the form of
what the narrator wants most. These themes seem to be common in many of his
most famous works and thus it begs the question, what is it in life that causes
the downfall of men into mental frailty and eventually doom? The answer is the
perfect woman that man can never have. In Ligeia, the description of the lady
love herself is almost beyond human, she was the “beauty which passed into my
spirit, there dwelling as in a shrine, I derived, from many existences in the
material world, a sentiment such as I felt always aroused within me by her
large and luminous orbs” (Poe 99). She is so perfectly beautiful he becomes
entranced by her beauty, he is “possessed with a passion to discover” (Poe 99)
the radiance she hides from the rest of the world.&nbsp;</p><p>  She is so perfect for his wondrous
nature he does not even ponder what the feeling of losing her would be until he
actually does. This sends him into a deep plight of grief which is also a
comment on how perfect Ligeia is, she is perfectly beautiful and causes the
most perfect grief; “That she loved me I should not have doubted; and I might
have been easily aware that, in a bosom such as hers, love would have reigned
no ordinary passion but in death only, was I fully impressed with the strength
of her affection” (Poe 101). The poem shifts from angelic descriptions of her
enchanting beauty to ones of hopelessness following her death because his own
internal self-worth only
comes from Ligeia’s love. His marriage to Rowena is therefore lackluster
because his happiness only rests in his memories. However, he would never be a
fully realized adult in Poe’s vision because he needs to lose her to know the
full weight of heartbreak. </p>

<p>  So, the loss of what the narrator of Ligeia
has perceived as his true love drives him into madness, in fact, it decimates
his chances of ever having a real relationship with another person. That being
stated, his marriage to Rowena was doomed from the start because the loss of
Ligeia has left him fully realized as to what love is and to him, that is
Ligeia, not Rowena or anyone else in the world. His fixation over his love for
his childhood love even seems to distract his full emotions when Rowena falls
ill, which points even more to this ideal of one true love. In this work, Poe
uses women for a catalyst to destroy men by being to perfect for them and only
remaining with them forever if they forgo any chance at future happiness with a
new suitor; that if you remain spiritually in debt to your ‘true love’ than
maybe one day, you will get to be with them again. [Good idea about being
spiritually in debt to the dead, perfect woman!]</p>

<p><i>  Annabel
Lee</i>, arguably one of Poe’s
most famous works to date, is one of the best examples of this same perfect
love is only perfect when coupled with perfect loss. It is love so perfect that
it must lead to absolute mental destruction because love is meant to be perfect
yet unattainable. According to The New World Encyclopedia, “Dark Romantics
[Poe, Melville, Hawthorne, most notably] are much less confident about the
notion perfection is an innate quality of mankind . . . individuals are prone
to sin and self-destruction, not inherently possessing divinity and wisdom”
(New World Encyclopedia Contributors). <i>Annabel
Lee</i> was Poe’s most best depiction of man who loses his mental stability
following the loss of true love, because unlike <i>Ligeia</i> where the love is resurrected, <i>Annabel Lee</i>’s narrator never gets his true, childhood love back but
instead spends the rest of his life “bringing the dreams / of the beautiful
Annabel Lee” (Poe 36-7). He will never be able to be as happy as he once was
while he was in love, but is instead content sleeping next to her tomb for the
rest of his days. This story is the ultimate dedication to perfect love and
loss and in fact on of the only ones in which the narrator experiences both
perfect loss and perfect love without ever getting his lost-love back. [Can he
get Annabel Lee back from death? Does he really get Ligeia back? Or is it just
some nightmarish version of her, or just his own opium-terror? I think it’s
interesting to argue that Ligeia and narrator are reunited at end in some sort
of celebration of their love, but you may need to make that case more clear in
your analysis.]</p>

<p><i>  Berenice</i> is a different taste of Poe, but one that is
too riddled with all the fixings of Poe’s commentary on the causes of men to
fall from stability. Instead of it being the loss of a woman, which directly
causes Egaeus, in this case, to lose his mind we find a narrator whose mind
already seems to be quite gone. He is obsessed with books and objects of
imagination that seem to alleviate his mind from his apparent boredom of living
in the “noon of manhood. . . still in the mansion of [his] father’s” (Poe 171).
Egaeus is a gloomy man set to marry his cousin Berenice but unlike the narrator
of Ligeia, Egaeus does not seek love he seeks escape and he does that through his
imagination. He sees himself as inherently different from Berenice, saying “I,
ill of health, and buried gloom – she agile, graceful, and overflowing with
energy; hers the ramble on the hill side, mine the studies of the cloister, I
living within my own heart and addicted body and soul to the most intense and
painful meditation – she roaming carelessly through life with no thought of the
shadows in her path” (Poe 172). Berenice is the narrators polar opposite; while
Ligeia was to perfect for her narrator, Berenice is to free for hers. The women
represent what the narrators long for but ultimately cannot have. Following
Berenice’s death, the Egaeus loses this fixation of freedom which eventually
leads him to mental downfall as he finds an object that both reminds him of her
freedom but also alleviates his obsessive needs to have something that allows
him to escape his life. Here, the woman also becomes the catalyst for man’s
downfall, only because she represents an idea of self-freedom the narrator
could never have himself instead of a romantic love; however, the idea that one
needs someone else in order to achieve this idea of fully realized self-freedom
also coincides with Poe’s theme of perfect loss and love in order to reach
self-actualization. </p>

<p><br></p><p>  There is no doubt that Poe was one of the
most celebrated writers of the Romantic period and of American literature in
general. One of these things that makes him the ideal Romantic author was his
ability to rebel against the popular literature he was raised in, namely the
works and ideologies of the age of Enlightment. John Fawell discusses in his
essay <i>Romanticism, Spirituality, and the
Contemporary University, </i>“when I teach Romanticism I often turn to one
passage from Edgar Allan Poe's short story ‘The Black Cat’ to get at what I
think is a central idea of Romanticism, the passage in which Poe's narrator
tries to understand, to explain to himself, why he has offered violence to his
favorite pet cat, first gouging out its eye and finally hanging it [and] concludes
that what lead him to hang the cat, what lead him to his ‘final and irrevocable
overthrow,’ was the ‘spirit of perverseness” (Fawell 223). [quote too long,
paraphrase idea] Poe describes this perverseness in <i>The Black Cat </i>as “the unfathomable longing of the soul to vex
itself” (Poe 65) as an almost innate need that dwells within each of us. In
other words, we are all built to eventually come to a downfall, so then if we
accept the definition of perverseness in this instance to mean, “willfully
determined or disposed to go counter of what is expected or desired” and we
know Romantic’s were typically rebellious against the Enlightment, perverseness
is a necessary element for Poe.</p>

<p>  Furthermore, if we accept this as a moral
ground that Poe upheld, the notion that in order to be self-actualized we must
know absolute acceptance and absolute rebellion, it would stand to reason why
all of his work resulted in the downfall. One cannot possibly achieve perfect
acceptance without rebellion against the established order and loss is common
when one is attempting to create something new or at least contribute to the
rising Romanticists, in his own case. This is poised to lead man into madness
and Poe was no stranger to such, as evidenced by his long plethora of macabre
works dedicated to the causes of the man’s madness.  It was rebellious to write unhappy stories and
this seemed to fuel Poe, someone who consistently felt dejected by society, as
well as “greatly depressed by reversal of fortune, separation from loved ones,
insecurity, and what to him was the frightful enigma of death” (Ostrom 44). </p>

<p>  Poe used downfall to keep readers interested,
utilizing it as a hook device to keep readers coming back to his strange tales.
In her essay <i>The hidden god and the
abjected woman in 'The Fall of the House of Usher,' </i>Diane Long Hoeveler
believes such a thing is just the case, that this keeps the reading searching
for an overall meaning when the meaning of <i>The
Fall of the House of Usher </i>is in fact abstract and up to interpretation.
She asserts, “we follow any lead Poe drops in front of us, following it to
blind passages and discover alas, only our mirror image staring back at us in
mockery” (Hoeveler 385). The book that the narrator reads to Roderick before
Madeline rises from the dead, Vigiliae Mortuorum, also raises this question of
religion and its importance to Poe’s work, but specifically here to <i>House of Usher</i>. The rare Latin book
highlights Roderick’s eccentric taste, but what this books presence in the
story suggests according to Hoeveler is that the “Vigiliae Mortuorum tropes a
religious history and ideology that have long been buried beneath the more
extravagant gothic surface of both its own text and ‘The Fall of the House’,
both which seemed to be written gothic and surely the reference to the book
conveys specifically discursive nature of history in the text” (Hoeveler
386-7). &nbsp;</p>

<p>  Essentially, society, which seems to rest
upon religion in a major way, is by nature, discursive. Religion has always
been surrounded by the mental downfall of not only individuals but also societies,
yet religion presents itself as immortal. Poe seemed to recognize this, and
this theme of religion as a catalyst for downfall seemed to even spill into
other works (i.e<i>. The Pit and the
Pendulum</i>).  This is not to say he did
not believe in God nor is that the assertion here, he just seemed to not see
God as a pure entity free of responsibility for the pain of human life. His use
of the twins of Roderick and Madeline in <i>Fall
of the House of Usher</i> could even be alluding to Christ and the Virgin Mary,
depicting the downfall of Christ as a result of religion’s failure to curb the
sins of humanity thus religion itself is seen as a failure, if we fully
recognize Hoeveler’s consensus as containing some sort of truth into Poe’s
mind. If we do, then Roderick and Madeline are the over-exaggeration products
of human ego, both wild hypochondriacs, doomed to downfall because of their
family’s devotion to society, which is depicted by their wealthy status and
thus social acceptance because of it, something Poe’s poverty never let him
know personally. “Poe suggests that [like the human emotions of love and loss],
history and religion can only be understood primarily as discourse systems,
dialogical constructs that sacrifice male strength and creativity to the
female- embodied powers of life and death, in other words, the cyclical nature
of generation, that [Roderick and Madeline] no longer believe in themselves
because they understand the fictional nature of both history and religion &amp;
consequently, like their creator, they only have the energy to self destruct”
(Hoeveler 387-8). Downfall is the natural cycle of life people wants to ignore
and Poe sought to naturalize within his texts. He truly makes the statement of
the woman as the ultimate catalyst for downfall however, and <i>Fall of the House</i> does not escape the
Poe technique because it is quite clear that “Roderick is the archetypal
dispossessed male, the victim of his own narcissistic fantasies of the perfect
feminine complement . . . Poe is the author of Roderick’s vision of cultural
decay and historical meaninglessness” (Hoeveler 392-3). </p>

<p>  Loss in this
century was a powerful commonality that could and often did guide, according to
Poe, the course of human life; this mourning of lost-love then by large,
becomes more dear than life itself. As Adam Bradford discusses in his essay <i>Inspiring
Death: Poe’s Poetic Aesthetics, “Annabel Lee,” and the Communities of Mourning
in Nineteenth-Century America </i>that the ritual of mourning in the American 19th  century was very different than it is
now, where as we do not commemorate death in the infinite manner that a writer
in the Romantic period such as Poe would have; “In mourning portraiture and
consolation verse, the deceased were frequently depicted enjoying a glorious
afterlife which included reunion and continued association with previously
departed family and loved ones. These affectively charged images, as I will
show, also held out the possibility of a similar reunion for the deceased and
the mourner in some future moment” (Bradford 76). &nbsp;So, then
Poe could not possibly have been the only Romantic writer that utilized this
theme of downfall into his work because in fact themes of downfall into madness
were prominent, although Poe was a leading figure in the macabre, downfall and
perfect love/loss were most definitely not unique to Poe but greatly used
amongst his contemporaries.</p>
